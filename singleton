The getInstance method demonstates another design pattern called Lazy Load. Lazy Load checks if an instance has already been created; if not, it creates one and stores it for future reference. All subsequent calls will receive the stored instance. Lazy loading is a CPU and memory saving technique 
by creating objects only when absolutely necessary.


var Singleton = (function () {
    var instance;
 
    function createInstance() {
        var object = new Object("I am the instance");
        return object;
    }
 
    return {
        getInstance: function () {
            if (!instance) {
                instance = createInstance();
            }
            return instance;
        }
    };
})();
 
function run() {
 
    var instance1 = Singleton.getInstance();
    var instance2 = Singleton.getInstance();
 
    alert("Same instance? " + (instance1 === instance2));  
}
