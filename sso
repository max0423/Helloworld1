The identity provider signs the SAML assertion or response using its own private key.

The service provider verifies the signature using the corresponding public key of the identity provider.

The only other consideration is with SP-initiated SSO the SAML authn request often is signed.

In this case the service provider signs the authn request with its private key and the identity provider verifies the signature using the corresponding public key.

The service provider has the option of using the same or different keys for signature generation and SAML assertion decryption.

One advantage of using the same key for signature generation and decryption is that there's one less certificate to distribute and manage.

The golden rule in all of this is that no party should ever divulge their private key to another party.
