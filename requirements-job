Hi Max

There is another position for Ministry of Transportation with same
rate.

Not sure if you are interested in it?

The project: Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills
Development (MLITSD) Certification Management System

MLITSD's Prevention Division is responsible for developing a
provincial Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) strategy and working
with Ontario's Health and Safety System partners to prevent workplace
injuries, illnesses and fatalities.

This initiative will implement a modern, greenfield, digital solution
to support Prevention Division's certification management, training
provider application/auditing process and 5-year occupational health
and safety system strategy. The outcome of this engagement will be to
launch a new digital solution that is suitable to support the
Prevention Works strategy and provide an intuitive, user-centric
experience for citizens, businesses and ministry staff to manage
certifications.

The new solution builds on the ministry's existing MLITSD 360 cloud
and microservices-based platform. To deliver this project, the
ministry will continue to use the successful practices from building
the MLITSD 360 platform by adhering to the Ontario Digital Services'
(ODS) Digital Standard and Design guide. The ministry engages with
stakeholders, conducts user interviews to understand user needs and
continuously seeks stakeholder feedback as features are developed. In
addition, the project will continue to use a balanced team approach,
as it allows the technical team to learn the business processes and
needs first-hand, and the product owner to experience the evolution of
the solution.
