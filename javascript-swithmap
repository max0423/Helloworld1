Static type-checking is the process of verifying the type safety of a program based on analysis of a program's source code.
Dynamic type-checking is the process of verifying the type safety of a program at runtime.


what is anonymous functions?

An anonymous function is a function that was declared without any named identifier to refer to it. As such, an anonymous function is 

usually not accessible after its initial creation.

what is arrow function?

An arrow function expression is a syntactically compact alternative to a regular function expression, although without its own bindings to 

the this, arguments, super, or new.target keywords. Arrow function expressions cannot be used as constructors.


what is typescript? 

TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of 

JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and 

transcompiles to JavaScript

what is promise?

A promise is an object that may produce a single value in the feature.
Promises is return from a function call, and have the reject and resolve function as parameter,
Which can according certain scenario to resolve or reject a value.

what is obeservable?

const button = document.querySelector('button')
const observable = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(button, 'click')
observable
  .switchMap(event => Rx.Observable.timer(1000)) // <- use the data of the first observable in the second one (if you want) and return the new observable
  .subscribe(data => console.log(data))
  
  import 'rxjs/add/observable/fromPromise';
import { Observable } from "rxjs/Observable";
// convet promise to observable
const subscription = Observable.fromPromise(
    firebase.auth().createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
);
subscription.subscribe(firebaseUser => /* Do anything with data received */,
                       error => /* Handle error here */);
                       
 RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is a library for reactive programming using observables 
 that makes it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code.


Observable provide support for passing message between publisher and subscriber in our app.
The observable is used for asynchrounrous stream data.
A stream of data possible asynchronous or possible multiple value over time. Whenever the observable emit a new value  and observer will 

execute the code when receive the value.


what is swithmap and mergemap and concat map?

swithmap:
Projects each source value to an Observable which is merged in the output Observable, emitting values only from the most recently 

projected Observable.

Mergemap:
Projects each source value to an Observable which is merged in the output Observable.

Concat map:
Projects each source value to an Observable which is merged in the output Observable, in a serialized fashion waiting for each one to 

complete before merging the next.



Containers:

Containers are an abstraction at the app layer
that packages code and dependencies together.
Multiple containers can run on the same machine
and share the OS kernel with other containers,
each running as isolaed processes in user space,
Containers take up less space then VMS,
and start almost instantly.

Virtual machines:

Virtual machines are abtraction of physical
hardware turning one server into many 
servers. the hypervisor allows multiple vms
to run on a single machine.
each VM includes a full copy of an operating
systemm, one or more apps, necessary binaries 
and libaries. VM can be slow to boot.
