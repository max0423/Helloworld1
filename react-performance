An inline function in render allocates a new function instance each time render is called. 
Some suggest that this will cause performance issues because the garbage collector will be be invoked more often.


PureComponent includes by default a shallow comparison of props and state in shouldComponentUpdate, 
meaning it wonâ€™t re-render with the same props and state.

Memoization is a powerful tool that acts as a cache: it takes a pure function as a parameter and 
is guaranteed to return the  same result of the last same input. 
In other words, with the same input it will return the memorized result of the last time you called it.
