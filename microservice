In microservices, every single service is independently deployable, scalable and updatable, 
this is what makes microservices such an appealing architectural approach to the industry.

A microservice is loosely coupled and interacts with other microservices for well-defined interfaces using protocols like http,
they remain consistent and available in the presence of failure, 

meaning even if the machine goes down that host a microservice, the functionality provided by the service should still be offered by the application.
