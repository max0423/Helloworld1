Mergemap
mergemap operator will take an outer observable and then
merge an inner observable into it.and whenever the inner observable then
emits a value it will also take the value of the outer observable into account to give us a combined value
the combined value the inner observable has to emit a value for the whole observable to update.


Switch map

using switchmap to connect two observable,when values being emitted on that outer observable, then it will
trigger the inner observalbe. also it cancle the outer observalbe.
you won't receive the outer observable event, you will receive the values of the inner observable.

combineLast
When any observable emits a value, emit the last emitted value from each.
