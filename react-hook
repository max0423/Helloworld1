React provides hooks, methods that get called automatically at each point in the lifecycle, that give you good control of what happens at the point it is invoked. A good understanding of these hooks will give you the power to effectively control and manipulate what goes on in a component throughout its lifetime.

Our lifecycle is broadly categorized into three parts: Mounting, Updating and Unmounting.

Mounting
These methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM:

constructor()
static getDerivedStateFromProps()
render()
componentDidMount()


Updating
An update can be caused by changes to props or state. These methods are called in the following order when a component is being re-rendered:

static getDerivedStateFromProps()
shouldComponentUpdate()
render()
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
componentDidUpdate()

Unmounting
This method is called when a component is being removed from the DOM:

componentWillUnmount()
