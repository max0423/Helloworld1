Pure Component:
Just like Pure Functions in JavaScript, a React component is considered a Pure Component if it renders the same output 
for the same state and props value. React provides the PureComponent base class for these class components. 
Class components that extend the React.PureComponent class are treated as pure components.


using PureComponents(for class components) and React.memo(for functional components).
PureComponents does a shallow comparison inorder to detect whether the rerender is required or not


The different between React Element and react component..
React Element - It is a simple object that describes a DOM node and its attributes or properties you can say.
It is an immutable description object and you can not apply any methods on it.
React Component - It is a function or class that accepts an input and returns a React element.


React provides hooks, methods that get called automatically at each point in the lifecycle, that give you good control of
what happens at the point it is invoked. A good understanding of these hooks will give you the power to effectively 
control and manipulate what goes on in a component throughout its lifetime.

Our lifecycle is broadly categorized into three parts: Mounting, Updating and Unmounting.

Mounting
These methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM:

constructor()
static getDerivedStateFromProps()
render()
componentDidMount()


Updating
An update can be caused by changes to props or state. These methods are called in the following order when a component is
being re-rendered:

static getDerivedStateFromProps()
shouldComponentUpdate()
render()
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
componentDidUpdate()

Unmounting
This method is called when a component is being removed from the DOM:

componentWillUnmount()


STATELESS COMPONENT declared as a function that has no state and returns the same markup given the same props.

PURE COMPONENT is one of the most significant ways to optimize React applications. The usage of Pure Component gives
a considerable increase in performance because it reduces the number of render operation in the application.

This is because PureComponent changes the life-cycle method shouldComponentUpdate and adds some logic to automatically
check whether a re-render is required for the component.
