 have accumulated over a decade of experience in IT development, traversing various industries and honing my skills along the way.

Presently, I am deeply engaged as a front-end React developer at BMO Bank, a role I have been devoted to for the past 12 months. 
Throughout this duration, my contributions have been nothing short of exceptional, 
as I have harnessed my strategic prowess to deliver remarkable value to my clients. The focal point of my endeavors has been the
execution of a visionary strategy, resulting in the creation and implementation of a scalable, responsive user interface. 
This interface has empowered customers with the ability to seamlessly manage their credit card accounts, peruse transaction histories, 
and conduct payments effortlessly.

Before my tenure at BMO, I graced the development landscape at RBC, where I held the position of a full-stack developer.
My focus there was on crafting an online trading system tailored for RBC Capital Markets, a project that amplified my expertise.
The trading platform manages and organizes these orders. Traders can usually view and modify their orders through the platform,
ensuring that all their buy orders are accurately represented.

Further back in my journey, I held a significant role at Scotiabank, where my skills as a full-stack developer came to fruition. 
I was deeply involved in a project that revolved around providing EFT payment recall and reverse services for Canadian customers.

As for my personal strengths, I take pride in my adeptness as a team player, my robust problem-solving acumen, and my insatiable 
appetite for acquiring new knowledge. My aspiration is to elevate my career to new heights, driven by a relentless pursuit of excellence.

The biggest challenge for the project of implementing Angular and Acuant library with reactive programming to implement the facial 
erification mobile app could be ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the facial recognition technology.
Facial recognition technology can be affected by various factors such as lighting, facial expressions, and image quality,
which can lead to false positives or false negatives. Therefore, it is important to thoroughly test and validate the facial recognition
feature to ensure that it works accurately and reliably in different scenarios and conditions. 
Additionally, it is important to ensure that the application complies with privacy and security regulations, 
as facial recognition technology can raise concerns about data privacy and security.
