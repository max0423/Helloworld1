Create a new file called store.js to set up the Redux store:
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import rootReducer from './reducers';

const store = createStore(rootReducer);

export default store;

In this example, we're using the createStore function from the redux library to create a new Redux store, 
and passing the rootReducer function as an argument. We're exporting the store so that we can use it in our React components.

Create a new file called reducers.js to define the Redux reducers:

const initialState = {
  count: 0
};

function rootReducer(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { ...state, count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

export default rootReducer;
