The useState function is a built in hook that can be imported from the react package.
 It allows you to add state to your functional components. 
Using the useState hook inside a function component, 
you can create a piece of state without switching to class components.

Hooks provide the useEffect() API. The api accepts a function as argument.
The function runs when the component is first rendered, and on every subsequent re-render/update.
